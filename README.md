# Wireframe-Interface
This project is a pretty cool one! I made a mock up of an interface menu, just like you see in video game consoles back in the day. I used A-Frame to get some cool 3D objects. I added lots of objects from this and animated them to ease in and out to loop around the screen. With the icons, I made them 2D and fixed them inside the camera to basically make an interface. I had to make the icons using objects instead of textures or random pictures. It was really not a big deal, but it did require lots of testing since I wanted to get this right. The main 4 are "PLAY GAME", "DATA", "LIBRARY", and "OPTIONS". I've also added the etc on the bottom bar to make it seem like it wasn't too unfinished. I wanted to add something on the top, like a time clock, but I thought it wasn't going to be necessary. It was pretty fun to work on this and hopefully I can make more like this in the future!
